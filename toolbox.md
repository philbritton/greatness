## Icing on The Cake ##
The little things that can make a *big* difference.  These modules, packages and scripts are often overlooked and will never *make* or *break* your application.  This stuff is sometimes so bleeding edge you need to wear a leather jacket and smash jukeboxes after you find it.  Sometimes you stumble upon 'workflow'/'life-changers' that can only be describe in a meme (maybe a gif).

Disclaimer:  as an outsider I cannot judge a true developer's abilities, but I can judge antiquated frameworks, shoddy UI and lazy implementation.  Most of all I can judge the willingness to accept and passionately learn new workflows.  

Things change and it's time to decide if you're a thing or a mere mortal.
